A world where technology interprets our thoughts, emotions, and intentions, bridging gaps in communication across cultures and languages. This is not science fiction; this is the promise of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Today, I stand before you to discuss the vital importance of training and learning NLP models and understanding their impact on our daily lives.\n",

The relevance of NLP in our interconnected world cannot be overstated. With the rise of digital communication, the ability to process and understand language has become essential across various fields, from healthcare to customer service.\n",
